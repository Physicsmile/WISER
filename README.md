## 🔎 Overview

![WISER](./imgs/WISER.pdf)

**Overview of the proposed WISER framework.** (1) Wider Search. We leverage an editor to produce text and image queries for dual-path retrieval, aggregating the top-$K$ results into a unified candidate pool.
  (2) Adaptive Fusion. We employ a verifier to assess the candidates with confidence scores, applying a multi-level fusion strategy for high-confidence results and triggering refinement for low-confidence ones.
  (3) Deeper Thinking. For uncertain retrievals, we leverage a refiner to analyze unmet modifications and then feed targeted suggestions back to the editor, iterating until a predefined limit is reached.



## 📊 Main Results

WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios.
